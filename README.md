## JavaScript Task Entry System: 


This project is a simple JavaScript-based task entry system built as part of a foundational coding assignment. It allows users to enter and validate details for two tasks directly in the browser using prompts.

##  Features 🫡

- Users are prompted to input:
  - Task title
  - Task description
  - Task status
- Status input is validated to accept only: `todo`, `doing`, or `done`
- All status inputs are automatically converted to lowercase for consistency
- Only tasks marked as `"done"` are displayed in the console
- If no tasks are completed, a motivational message appears

| Technology | Purpose                      |
|------------|------------------------------|
| HTML       | Basic page structure         |
| JavaScript | Logic, prompts, and validation |
| CSS      | Styles web page layout  |

##  What I Learned 🧠

- How to collect user input with `prompt()`
- Using functions to enforce input validation
- Looping until correct input is received
- Filtering arrays and conditionally logging data
- Writing readable, maintainable code using clear variable names and comments

##  How to Run the Project 🏃🏾‍♀️

| Step | Action                                                    |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Clone the repository or download the project ZIP          |
| 2    | Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser  |
| 3    | Follow the prompts to enter task details                  |
| 4    | Open the browser console to view the output (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or right-click > Inspect > Console tab) |

##  Example Console Output 💻

When a task is marked as `done`: `Titile`: Clean, `status`: done


When there are no completed Tasks: No tasks completed, `let's` get to work!
